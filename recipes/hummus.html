    <h1>Hummus</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade hummus is very easy to make and it tastes much better than anything you can buy at the store. If you don't have
    any tahini, a paste made from sesame seeds, you can try making it yourself or leave it out.
    A chickpea purée without it is still quite delicious. Just add more olive oil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas or 1 ½ cups (250 grams) cooked chickpeas</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice (about one large lemon)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) well-stirred tahini</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) water or aquafaba</li>
        <li>Dash ground paprika or sumac, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Necessary Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Food processor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and
                bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making the
                hummus smooth and creamy.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for
                30 seconds, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 seconds or until well blended. Open, drain,
                and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and
                bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth; 1 to 2 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>

                Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor
                turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus
                in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week.
            </p>
