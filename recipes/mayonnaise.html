    <h1>Mayonnaise</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade mayonnaise is such a treat. It's very simple to make, too. Room temperature ingredients are best when making
    mayonnaise at home. If you're not able to wait for the egg to come to room temperature, submerge it in lukewarm (not
    hot) water for a couple of minutes. There are a few ways to make mayonnaise. We use our food processor with the small
    bowl attachment, but an immersion blender or making it completely by hand and large whisk will work. (Expect tired arms
    and strong biceps if you do choose to do it by hand).</p>
    
    <p>All ingredients need to be at the same temperature. If you have cold eggs and no time to leave them out on the counter
    to come to room temperature, place the egg into a bowl of warm water. Set it aside for a few minutes before using in the
    recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg <strong>at room temperature</strong></li>
        
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) neutral flavored oil, grapeseed, safflower or canola are best</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recommended Equipment</h2>

    <h3>Prepare Equipment</h3>

        <li>
            <p>
                If you have a large food processor, use the smaller bowl attachment that came with your processor so that the bowl is
                not too large for the amount of mayonnaise this recipe makes. Not using the smaller bowl can prevent the mayonnaise from
                emulsifying since the mixture will not have enough contact with the blade.

                <em>
                    If you do not the smaller bowl attachment, making the mayonnaise with an immersion blender or by hand are alternatives.
                    Or simply make a larger batch and double the recipe and use the standard bowl attachment. You might find success with a
                    high-speed blender, but based on reviews and comments from readers, using a blender seems to be less fail-proof.

    <h3>Make Mayonnaise</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add egg to the small bowl of a food processor and process for 20 seconds. Add the mustard, vinegar, and salt. Process
                for another 20 seconds.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, turn the food processor on then begin to slowly add the oil in tiny drops until
                about a quarter of the oil has been added (this is critical for proper emulsification).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                When you notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken and emulsify, you can be a little less strict. With the
                processor on, continue to add it slowly, but increase to a very thin stream instead of drops of oil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                When all of the oil has been added, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and process for an extra 10 seconds. Taste
                mayonnaise for seasoning then add salt, lemon juice or extra vinegar to taste.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Note, if the mayo seems too thin, slowly stream in more oil with the processor running until thick.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Storing Homemade Mayonnaise: Store covered in the refrigerator up to a week.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Raw eggs: When choosing eggs for homemade mayonnaise, go for fresh, properly refrigerated, clean grade A or AA eggs with
                intact shells.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Olive oil: Olive oil can be a little overpowering so use one that's light and fruity and consider only replacing half of
                the oil called for in the recipe with olive oil and use something more neutral for the rest.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fixing Broken Mayonnaise: While we have never had this recipe for mayonnaise break on us, if it happens to you don't
                fret! You really should be able to fix it. Add about 1 teaspoon of mustard to a bowl then slowly beat the broken
                mayonnaise into the mustard until it becomes emulsified and creamy again (a tip from Julia Child). Another trick is to
                repeat the same process, but replace the teaspoon of mustard with an egg yolk.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
