    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade French bread is made with flour, water, yeast, and salt. It can be mixed either by hand or a stand mixer
    and shaped into your favorite form. Once baked, the crust is golden and crispy. As it cools, it becomes a super soft
    French loaf you can use for anything.</p>

        <li>measuring spoons</li>
        <li>instant-read thermometer</li>
        <li>stirring utensil to combine ingredients</li>
        <li>stand mixer (if using electric mixing)</li>
        <li>pastry brush</li>
        <li>baking sheet</li>
        <li>baker's lame or razor blade (to score the dough)</li>
        <li>oven mitts</li>
        <li>cooling rack</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Optional Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>digital scale - weigh ingredients and bread dough</li>
        <li>Instant Pot - for proofing dough</li>
        <li>plate or lid that covers the Instant Pot during dough proofing</li>
        <li>dough whisk - combines dough ingredients before kneading</li>
        <li>bowl scraper - helps remove sticky dough from mixing bowl</li>
        <li>sandwich loaf pan or baguette pan - helps shape and add height to loaves</li>
        <li>bread knife - serrated edges will cut straight lines</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Combine</strong> *WARM WATER and YEAST in mixing bowl or stand mixer bowl fitted with the dough hook attachment.</p>
        <p>* <em>Active Dry Yeast</em> needs 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit water temperature. Combine and allow 5 minute rest until the yeast surfaces.</p>
        <p>* <em>Quick Rise Instant Yeast</em> needs 120 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit water temperature. Combine and proceed to step 2.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Add</strong> FLOUR and SALT (reserve ½ cup flour to assist mixing). <strong>Stir</strong> ingredients together with a utensil (or stand mixer on <em>lowest</em> speed) until a shaggy dough forms.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Mix and knead</strong> dough with your hands (or stand mixer on low speed) about 5 minutes until it becomes stretchy and pliable. During mixing, <strong>sprinkle</strong> tiny amounts of the reserved flour into the bowl to prevent sticking.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Transfer</strong> dough to a lightly floured surface and <strong>shape</strong> into a tight, round form, <strong>tucking</strong> the sides under to form a seam on the bottom.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Perform 1st proof/rise</strong> by placing dough in an oil-coated mixing bowl (or Instant Pot), seam side down. <strong>Cover</strong> with a towel or draped plastic wrap and allow to double in size.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Deflate</strong> the dough (aka punch it down) to remove air bubbles. You can move on to the next step, or...</p>
        <p><strong>Perform 2nd proof/rise</strong> by shaping the dough into a tight round and repeat step 5. (The 2nd proof/rise is optional, but recommended to further develop texture and flavor)</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and let's shape these loaves...</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer</strong> the dough onto lightly floured surface. <strong>Press</strong> to deflate air pockets and <strong>divide</strong> dough into 2 or 3 equal sections.</p>
        <p><strong>Press</strong> each piece into a loose rectangle shape.</p>
        <p><strong>Fold and press</strong> dough into itself until it becomes tight while <strong>forming</strong> it into the final shape (baguette, loaf, or round).</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer</strong> to a prepared baking sheet or loaf pan. <strong>Brush</strong> surface with olive oil and <strong>cover</strong> to prevent air exposure.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><strong>Perform final proof/rise by</strong> resting forms in a warm spot until nearly doubled in size.</p>
        <p><strong>Score</strong> the dough by making ¼-inch slits across each loaf with a sharp tool.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Bake</strong> 20-25 minutes, rotating halfway through, as needed for even browning.</p>
        <p>Fully baked French bread will be crisp and golden brown. If tested with a quick-read thermometer, it should be between 190 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Note: The crisp surface will completely soften once it cools.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Transfer</strong> loaves onto a cooling rack and rest 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Remove</strong> loaves from pans and rest on the cooling rack until completely cooled (to retain moisture).</p>
        <p><strong>Store</strong> cooled bread in a plastic bag or airtight container up to 2 days at room temperature or 5 days in the refrigerator.</p></li>
